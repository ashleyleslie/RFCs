# RFC 0013 - IGACC Workflow in Zesty.io

## Summary

All development teams have a workflow. Some work better for others at different sizes, office setups, team distribution etc., and it is a highly subjective and opinionated subject. We are going to clearly define a workflow it his RFC for engineers at Zesty.io. This will be a public document for both our internal team and external community to understand how the product evolves.

Our workflow is one that starts with an idea and ends with customer communication. IGACC (idea > goal > activity > completion > communication).

## IGACC WorkFlow

1. Idea is introduced
 	* Origination
		* Idea originates from user feature request
		* Idea originates from internal team based on industry need
		* Idea originates from requirement on the product roadmap
	* Idea is documented in a place that those discussing it all have access to
	* Idea Discussion *(three possible paths)*
 		* a) Idea stays an idea for refinement (stays in Step 1)
		* b) Idea is converted to a Goal (proceeds to Step 2)
		* c) Idea is turned down (terminated, documented, and removed from the flow)
2. Idea is Converted to a Goal
	* Goal is entered into the *Goal Queue*
	* Goals are assigned to an owner
	* Goals owner writes an RFCs and cover scope, dependencies, roadblocks etc.
	* Goal is discussed with a needs analysis, and given a target date
3. Goal Becomes Active
	* Goal leaves the queue and enters the active state
 	* Goal owner reviews RFC, builds task List
	* Task list is reviewed with Goal Owner's manager
	* Time is allocated to job task list, tasks are assigned to team members, and job is placed into roadmap.
	* Team members start working against tasks to completion
4. Goal is Completed
	* Goal Owner communicates launch plan to manager
	* Goal is documented by the GO for both end user and internal consumption
5. Customer Communication
	* Existing user base is notified to help them apply value to their existing product usage
	* The market is alerted to help organizations understand prospective product usage


## IGACC Terms

**Product**: Software a user system can interact with.

**Idea**: The concept of change or addition that add value to a product.

**Goal**: the overarching tasks of an idea, that when complete, produce a component, feature, or concept of a product.

**RFC**: Request for Comments (RFC) is a document that summarizes an Idea, and lays the foundation to describe the goal and tasks of the goal. This document is intended to be reviewed and commented on by peers to strengthen the idea for better usage and to refine the goal tasks for more accurate resource allocation.

**GO** *(Gee-Oh)*: Goal Owner (GO) is the person responsible for documenting, organizing, and seeing a goal through completion.

**Task**: Description of a job that when combined with other jobs, they describe the entirety of a Goal.

**Active Goals**: Where Goals being worked on are tracked.

**Goal Queue**: Where Goals are developed and stored. This can be in a project management software or a simple spreadsheet.
