# RFC 0013 - Development Workflow in Zesty.io

## Summary

All development teams have a workflow. Some work better for others at different sizes, office setups, team distribution etc., and it is a highly subjective and opinionated subject. We are going to clearly define a workflow it his RFC for engineers at Zesty.io. This will be a public document for both our internal team and external community to understand how the product evolves.

## WorkFlow Example

1. Goal Origination
	* Goal originates from user feature request
	* Goal originates from internal team based on industry need
	* Goal originates from requirement on the product roadmap
2. Goal is filed into Zesty.io's internal tracking software by an internal Zesty.io Team Member
3. Goal is discussed by Zesty.io team and one of two things happen
 	* Goal stays in discussion (Step 3)
	* Goal is converted to a job (proceeds to Step 4)
4. Goal is converted to a job in the Engineering Queue
	* Jobs are assigned to an owner
	* Jobs owner writes an RFCs and cover scope, dependencies, roadblocks etc.
	* Goal is discussed with a needs analysis, and given a target date
5. Job leaves queue and becomes active
 	* Job owner reviews RFC, builds task List
	* Task list is reviewed with job owners manager
	* Time is allocated to job task list, and is placed into roadmap.
6. Engineers start working against tasks to completion
7. Goal is completed
	* Job Owner communicates what happens to manager
	* Job is documented by the JO for both user and internal consumption
8. Results are announced by Zesty.io's Communication Team


## Terms

**JO** *Job Owner:* the person responsible for documenting, organizing, and seeing a goal through completion
