# RFC 0013 - Development Workflow in Zesty.io

## Summary

All development teams have a workflow. Some work better for others at different sizes, office setups, team distribution etc., and it is a highly subjective and opinionated subject. We are going to clearly define a workflow here for developers at Zesty.io. This will be a public document for both our internal team and external community to understand how the product evolves.
