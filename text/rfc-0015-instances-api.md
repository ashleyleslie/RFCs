# RFC 0015 - Instances API

## Summary

The Instances API is a programmatic HTTP Rest API to control all aspects of the Zesty.io content manager system.

## Motivation

We are opening up Zesty.io instances for external and internal developers. This will allow us to internally to decouple the interface from the functionality. Externally, customer developers or 3rd party developers will be able to build against our API, provide open source solutions, and integrated our system into other software.
